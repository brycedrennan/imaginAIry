**14.0.4**
- docs: add a documentation website at https://brycedrennan.github.io/imaginAIry/
- build: remove fairscale dependency
- fix: video generation was broken

**14.0.3**
- fix: several critical bugs with package
- tests: add a wheel smoketest to detect these issues in the future

**14.0.0**
- ðŸŽ‰ video generation using [Stable Video Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models)
  - add `--videogen` to any image generation to create a short video from the generated image
  - or use `aimg videogen` to generate a video from an image
- ðŸŽ‰ SDXL (Stable Diffusion Extra Large) models are now supported.
  - try `--model opendalle` or `--model sdxl`
  - inpainting and controlnets are not yet supported for SDXL
- ðŸŽ‰ imaginairy is now backed by the [refiners library](https://github.com/finegrain-ai/refiners)
  - This was a huge rewrite which is why some features are not yet supported.  On the plus side, refiners supports
cutting edge features (SDXL, image prompts, etc) which will be added to imaginairy soon.
  - [self-attention guidance](https://github.com/SusungHong/Self-Attention-Guidance) which makes details of images more accurate
- ðŸŽ‰ feature: larger image generations now work MUCH better and stay faithful to the same image as it looks at a smaller size. 
For example `--size 720p --seed 1` and `--size 1080p --seed 1` will produce the same image for SD15
- ðŸŽ‰ feature: loading diffusers based models now supported. Example `--model https://huggingface.co/ainz/diseny-pixar --model-architecture sd15`
- ðŸŽ‰ feature: qrcode controlnet!
- feature: generate word images automatically. great for use with qrcode controlnet: `imagine "flowers" --gif --size hd --control-mode qrcode --control-image "textimg='JOY' font_color=white background_color=gray" -r 10`
- feature: opendalle 1.1 added. `--model opendalle` to use it
- feature: added `--size` parameter for more intuitive sizing (e.g. 512, 256x256, 4k, uhd, FHD, VGA, etc)
- feature: detect if wrong torch version is installed and provide instructions on how to install proper version
- feature: better logging output: color, error handling
- feature: support for pytorch 2.0
- feature: command line output significantly cleaned up and easier to read
- feature: adds --composition-strength parameter to cli (#416)
- performance: lower memory usage for upscaling
- performance: lower memory usage at startup
- performance: add sliced attention to several models (lowers memory use)
- fix: simpler memory management that avoids some of the previous bugs
- deprecated: support for python 3.8, 3.9
- deprecated: support for torch 1.13
- deprecated: support for Stable Diffusion versions 1.4, 2.0, and 2.1

  - The inpainting controlnet doesn't work as well as the finetuned model
- feature: python interface allows configuration of controlnet strength

- ðŸŽ‰ feature: add "shuffle" control mode. Image is generated from elements of control image. Similar to style transfer.

- fix: image composition didn't work very well. Works well now but probably very slow on non-cuda platforms
- fix: remove upscaler tiling message
- fix: improve k-diffusion sampler schedule. significantly improves image quality of default sampler
- fix: img2img was broken for all samplers except plms and ddim when init image strength was >~0.25

**10.2.0**
 - feature: input raw control images (a pose, canny map, depth map, etc) directly using `--control-image-raw`

- perf: sliced latent decoding - now possible to make much bigger images. 3310x3310 on 11 GB GPU.

**9.0.2**
- fix: edit interface was broken

**9.0.1**
- fix: use entry_points for windows since setup.py scripts doesn't work on windows [#239](https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry/issues/239)

**9.0.0**

- perf: cli now has minimal overhead such that `aimg --help` runs in ~650ms instead of ~3400ms

batch editing of images as requested in [#229](https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry/issues/229)

Try this for example: `imagine --tile-x -w 1024 -h 512 "360 degree equirectangular panorama photograph of the mountains"  --upscale`

**7.1.1**

**5.1.0**
- feature: add progress image callback

**5.0.1**
- fix: support larger images on M1. Fixes #8
- fix: support CPU generation by disabling autocast on CPU. Fixes #81

**5.0.0**
- feature: ðŸŽ‰ inpainting support using new inpainting model from RunwayML. It works really well! By default, the 
inpainting model will automatically be used for any image-masking task

 - feature: allow dynamic switching between models/weights `--model SD-1.5` or `--model SD-1.4` or `--model path/my-custom-weights.ckpt`)
 - feature: log total progress when generating images (image X out of Y)

**4.0.0**
 - feature: stable diffusion 1.5 (slightly improved image quality)
 - feature: dilation and erosion of masks
 Previously the `+` and `-` characters in a mask (example: `face{+0.1}`) added to the grayscale value of any masked areas. This wasn't very useful. The new behavior is that the mask will expand or contract by the number of pixel specified. The technical terms for this are dilation and erosion.  This allows much greater control over the masked area.
 - feature: update k-diffusion samplers. add k_dpm_adaptive and k_dpm_fast
 - feature: img2img/inpainting supported on all samplers
 - refactor: consolidates img2img/txt2img code. consolidates schedules. consolidates masking

 - feature: face enhancement fidelity is now configurable

**2.1.0**
 - [improved masking accuracy from clipseg](https://github.com/timojl/clipseg/issues/8#issuecomment-1259150865)

**2.0.3**
 - fix memory leak in face enhancer
 - fix blurry inpainting 
 - fix for pillow compatibility

**2.0.0**
 - ðŸŽ‰ fix: inpainted areas correlate with surrounding image, even at 100% generation strength.  Previously if the generation strength was high enough the generated image
would be uncorrelated to the rest of the surrounding image.  It created terrible looking images.   
 - ðŸŽ‰ feature: interactive prompt added. access by running `aimg`
 - ðŸŽ‰ feature: Specify advanced text based masks using boolean logic and strength modifiers. Mask descriptions must be lowercase. Keywords uppercase.
   Valid symbols: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `()`, and mask strength modifier `{+0.1}` where `+` can be any of `+ - * /`. Single character boolean operators also work (`|`, `&`, `!`)
 - ðŸŽ‰ feature: apply mask edits to original files with `mask_modify_original` (on by default)
 - feature: auto-rotate images if exif data specifies to do so
 - fix: mask boundaries are more accurate

 - fix: make sure image tensors come to the CPU as float32 so there aren't compatibility issues with non-bfloat16 cpus

**1.6.0**
 - fix: *maybe* address #13 with `expected scalar type BFloat16 but found Float`
   - at minimum one can specify `--precision full` now and that will probably fix the issue  
 - feature: tile mode can now be specified per-prompt

**1.5.3**
 - fix: missing config file for describe feature

**1.5.1**
 - img2img now supported with PLMS (instead of just DDIM)
 - added image captioning feature `aimg describe dog.jpg` => `a brown dog sitting on grass`
 - added new commandline tool `aimg` for additional image manipulation functionality

**1.4.0**
 - support multiple additive targets for masking with `|` symbol.  Example: "fruit|stem|fruit stem"

**1.3.0**
 - added prompt based image editing. Example: "fruit => gold coins"
 - test coverage improved

**1.2.0**
 - allow urls as init-images

**previous**
 - img2img actually does # of steps you specify  
 - performance optimizations
